            What is the Future of Logistics?

        <h2><span class="h2-num">01</span>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            As we are rapidly moving towards digitalization. Most industries are also adapting changes for themselves so
            that they
            could easily grow in the era of digitalization. And just like other industries Logistics industry is one of
            the industry
            which is also adapting to the little changes which would help them to expand more in the future. But what
            would the
            future of the logistics industry look like? Let us take a glimpse of the logistic industry future.
        </p>
        <h2><span class="h2-num">02</span>Content</h2>
        <p>
            The traditional way of connecting through phone calls will be fully eliminated By the apps. Apps or vehicles
            probably
            have a sleeping system mechanism that would help drivers to have a quality of sleep when they will be
            covering a long
            distance.
        </p>
        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.1</span>How Technology Is Changing the Future of Logistics?</h3>
        <p class="h3-p">
            As we are rapidly moving towards digitalization. Most industries are also adapting changes for themselves so
            that they
            could easily grow in the era of digitalization. And just like other industries Logistics industry is one of
            the industry
            which is also adapting to the little changes which would help them to expand more in the future. But what
            would the
            future of the logistics industry look like? Let us take a glimpse of the logistic industry future.

            As of now, we only know that the logistic industry has potential but due to an unorganized industry and
            ill-treatment of
            drivers, its potential is yet to be achieved.
        </p>
        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.2</span>Technologies “MUST” Have</h3>
        <p class="h3-p">
            The technology has evolved in a great way and some of the technology used will be:
        </p>
        <ul class="h3-p-ul">
            <li>GPS will evolve more we would probably be able to know the location in 3D form.</li>
            <li>JIT or Just In Time deliveries, which were accessible to a select few, could become a norm as digital
                technology makes deliveries, schedule management, route planning, and cargo monitoring all possible in
                real time.</li>
            <li>In the future in simple term truck will move through AI or through remote. through AI we would just need
                to enter the
                pickup and drop location in the system and then everything will be done by AI we just need to monitor
                the truck that's
                it.</li>
            <li>
                We could also see the DRONE delivery in the near future but DRONE would probably be used for lightweight
                goods or for
                delivery where vehicles cant be reached for example in hilly areas.

            </li>

        </ul>
        <p class="h3-p">
            These advances in technology will obviously result in goods being delivered around the corner, to the next
            town, to
            the
            next country, and around the world in a way that is more efficient, quick and cost effective. But, it is not
            only
            that.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="h2-num">03</span>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, technology has changed the way we do business. This is true for all industries, but logistics
            is no
            exception. We are now able to do things that were once impossible. For example, we are able to track
            shipments in
            real-time, manage inventory and orders more efficiently, and even predict demand. This is just the beginning
            of what the
            future holds.
