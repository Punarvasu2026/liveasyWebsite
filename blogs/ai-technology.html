            How AI Technology is used?
        </h1>
        <h2><span class="h2-num">01</span>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Logistics centers on the movement of goods, but its effects extend much further. In business, success in
            logistics
            translates to increased efficiencies, lower costs, higher production rates, better inventory control,
            smarter use of
            warehouse space, increased customer and supplier satisfaction, and an improved customer experienceThe very
            essence of a
            business is to exchange goods or services for money or trade.
        </p>
        <h2><span class="h2-num">02</span>Content</h2>
        <p>
            AI technology continues to transform the logistics sector in profound ways in order to expedite shipments.
            There are
            numerous advantages to logistics enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Each stage of the logistics can
            benefit from
            Artificial Intelligence.
        </p>
        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.1</span>Benefits of using AI technology in logistics</h3>

        </div>
        <ul class="h3-p-ul">
            <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Accurate Inventory Management: </span>Due to its capacity for handling
                large amounts of data, AI-driven technologies can be extremely useful in inventory
                management. Accurate inventory management can help ensure that products enter and exit a warehouse in
                the proper
                sequence.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">SMART roads: </span>Another application of artificial intelligence in
                the logistics industry is smart roads. Several companies are working
                on building them. Smart roads help improve road safety and reduce delays in the supply chain caused by
                unfavorable
                weather conditions, making deliveries faster.
            </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Predictive Maintenance: </span>Predictive maintenance is predicting
                potential machine failures in the factory by analyzing real-time data collected
                from IoT sensors in machines. Machine learning-powered analytics tools enhance predictive analytics and
                identify
                patterns in sensor data so that technicians can take action before the failure occurs.

        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.2</span>How AI is Transforming the Logistics Industry</h3>
        <p class="h3-p">
            Most industries, including logistics, have been transformed by the advancement of new technologies such as
            artificial
            intelligence (AI). Autonomous vehicles, warehouse automation, predictive analytics, and smart roads are all
            examples of
            technologies that are becoming the new norm today. 
        </p>
        <p class="h3-p">
            Companies are beginning to see the value of machine learning and the advantages of using expertise of AI providers to
            improve production and delivery. It’s no surprise that tech giants like Google and Tesla have begun to invest in AI. As
            a result, we’ve decided to analyze and share everything you need to know about artificial intelligence in the logistics
            industry.
        </p>

        
        <h2><span class="h2-num">03</span>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
            Leading logistics organizations are already harnessing AI and machine learning. To put it plainly, AI-driven
            technologies are developed to mimic and imitate human thinking and to exceed humans in terms of the efficiency of
            data-driven decision making. AI is the best assistant for global supply chains in managing assets and facilities in the
            most cost-efficient way. The use of AI-based predictive analytics can help transportation services providers optimize
            route planning and delivery schedules. Also, the technology-based approach ensures improved asset performance due to
            timely maintenance, which results in the reduction of cases of failures.
