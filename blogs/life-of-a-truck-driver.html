            What is the Future of Logistics?
        </h1> -->
        <h2><span class="h2-num">01</span>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            As we are rapidly moving towards digitalization. Most industries are also adapting changes for themselves so
            that they
            could easily grow in the era of digitalization. And just like other industries Logistics industry is one of
            the industry
            which is also adapting to the little changes which would help them to expand more in the future. But what
            would the
            future of the logistics industry look like? Let us take a glimpse of the logistic industry future.

        </p>
        <h2><span class="h2-num">02</span>Content</h2>
        <p>
            The traditional way of connecting through phone calls will be fully eliminated By the apps. Apps or vehicles
            probably
            have a sleeping system mechanism that would help drivers to have a quality of sleep when they will be
            covering a long
            distance
        </p>
        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.1</span>What does the survey say?</h3>
        <p class="h3-p">
            A survey was conducted in which it was found that more than 53% of the respondent were not satisfied with
            their
            profession. and the reasons were low income, harassment from police, RTO inefficiency, corruption, local
            group
            misbehavior, unscheduled working hours, and last but not least less time with family and more time with
            roads. Not only
            that it was also founded that 9 out of 10 drivers haven’t received any formal training.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.2</span>Death rate of Truck drivers has increased</h3>
        <p class="h3-p">
            There is also a risk of Life as of 2018 data more than 1.5 lakh deaths on the road were of truck drivers of
            which 1500+
            deaths were of truck and lorry drivers. To earn a good amount they were forced to overload their vehicle
            which end up
            having the risk of their life. Drivers are forced to reach their destination even before the time which
            results in more
            driving hours and a lack of sleep. </p>
        <p class="h3-p">
            They have more risk of life as compared to others. Even the government has setupped up to slow down the
            deaths of the
            driver by setting up highway patrolling unit but it hasn’t worked out what was expected. The truck driver
            job is not
            only a tough job for drivers but also for their family too. family too suffer because as drivers are away
            from home for
            15 - 20 days their family members are in constant worry whether their loved ones are fine or not whether
            they have eaten
            the food or not and many more.

        </p>

        <h2><span class="h2-num">03</span>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, technology has changed the way we do business. This is true for all industries, but logistics
            is no
            exception. We are now able to do things that were once impossible. For example, we are able to track
            shipments in
            real-time, manage inventory and orders more efficiently, and even predict demand. This is just the beginning
            of what the
            future holds.
