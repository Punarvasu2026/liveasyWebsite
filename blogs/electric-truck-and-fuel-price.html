        <h2><span class="h2-num">01</span>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Electric trucks are the future of transportation. It's a no-brainer for companies and truckers — electrifying trucks is
            cheaper in the long term, and it doesn't require a dependence on expensive gasoline.
        </p>
        <h2><span class="h2-num">02</span>Content</h2>
        <p>
            AI technology continues to transform the logistics sector in profound ways in order to expedite shipments. There are
            numerous advantages to logistics enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Each stage of the logistics can benefit from
            Artificial Intelligence.
        </p>
        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.1</span>Electric vehicles maybe the answer for rising fuel prices</h3>
        <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="../assets/blogs/Electric-vehicles-rising-of-fuel-price.png" alt="">
        
        </div>
        <p class="h3-p">
            Petrol and diesel prices are at an all-time high. In Mumbai, petrol crossed the ₹ 100 per litre mark on May 29, with
            diesel not far behind at ₹ 93 per litre. In June last year, petrol was about ₹ 20 per litre cheaper in Mumbai at ₹ 80.
            In Delhi, petrol prices touched ₹ 95 per litre, as compared to ₹71 per litre last year.
        </p>
        <p class="h3-p">
            Most parts of the country are witnessing this continuous hike in fuel prices, pushing commuters to look for cheaper
            mobility solutions. Electric vehicles (EVs) are a potential low-cost alternative that may get traction in the current
            scenario of rising operational costs of petrol and diesel vehicles. Powered directly by the grid, EVs are increasingly
            proving to be operationally cheaper for their owners than petrol and diesel vehicles in terms of their total cost of
            ownership (TCO).
        </p>
        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.2</span>Changing scenarios of the fuel and EV Markets</h3>
        <p class="h3-p">
            Many countries have already established targets to stop manufacturing petrol/diesel vehicles by 2025-2040. In India, the
            sale of new petrol/diesel cars will be banned from 2030.
            Recently, India’s top oil PSUs publicised to open 78,493 new petrol pumps while we already have 64,624 petrol pumps.
            This sudden pronouncement comes from the panic in oil companies that the demand for fuel will decline in the coming
            decades. So, the PSUs probably decided to increase fuel sales significantly.
        </p>
        <p class="h3-p">
            Off-late, many electric vehicles have become available in the market, which includes four-wheelers and 3/2 wheelers too.
            As of now, electric vehicles’ sales are only about 7.2 % of total vehicle sales. This is expected to rise to 40% by
            2030, and by 2040 every new car will be electric in the world.

        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.3</span>Benefits of Electric Trucks</h3>
        <ul class="h3-p-ul">
            <li>Lower emissions</li>
            <li>Lower maintenance</li>
            <li>Lower noise disturbance</li>
            <li>Better performance</li>
            <li>Increased efficiency</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="h3-p">
            It is always cheaper to charge your electric truck than spending money on gas. Electric trucks provide businesses with
            many benefits that primarily aim for the long run. EV trucks do not require fuel, which is already one of the biggest
            advantages, due to fuel cost and effect on nature. Driving electric trucks reduces CO2 emissions and actually offers
            better performance for drivers. EV trucks also have less parts, which should lead to less damage and lower maintenance.
            However, this depends on a truck model and its usage. While driving within urban areas with frequent stops and speeding,
            it is way more efficient to drive electric truck than diesel truck.
        </p>
        
        <h2><span class="h2-num">03</span>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
            The progress that the electric vehicle industry has seen in recent years is not only extremely welcomed, but highly
            necessary in light of the increasing global greenhouse gas levels. As demonstrated within the economic, social, and
            environmental analysis sections of this webpage, the benefits of electric vehicles far surpass the costs. The biggest
            obstacle to the widespread adoption of electric-powered transportation is cost related, as gasoline and the vehicles
            that run on it are readily available, convenient, and less costly. As is demonstrated in our timeline, we hope that over
            the course of the next decade technological advancements and policy changes will help ease the transition from
            traditional fuel-powered vehicles.
