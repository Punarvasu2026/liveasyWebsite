                What is the need of Logistic for Business?
            </h1>
            <h2><span class="h2-num">01</span>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Logistics centers on the movement of goods, but its effects extend much further. In business, success in
                logistics
                translates to increased efficiencies, lower costs, higher production rates, better inventory control,
                smarter use of
                warehouse space, increased customer and supplier satisfaction, and an improved customer experienceThe
                very essence of a
                business is to exchange goods or services for money or trade.
            </p>
            <h2><span class="h2-num">02</span>Content</h2>
            <p>
                Logistics is the path those goods and services take to complete the transactions. Sometimes goods are
                moved in bulk,
                such as raw goods to a manufacturer. And sometimes goods are moved as individual disbursements, one
                customer at a time.
            </p>
            <h3><span class="h3-num">02.1</span>How Logistic Industry works in Business?</h3>
            <p class="h3-p">
                As we all know that logistic industry is a backbone of an economy and still in India logistic industry
                is one of the
                most unorganised industry due to which many businesses as well as individuals are suffering in finding
                proper logistics
                for their (load) businesses and even if they did find out the right vehicles\logistic for their load
                there's still a
                problem wheather the driver would go to the destination or not where you need to get your load and even
                if driver would
                agreed to go to the destination and there is a still problem in tracking them as there can be chances
                that driver would
                say that he\she is reaching to the destination in 5 min but actual time would be 2 hours.
            </p>
            <h3><span class="h3-num">02.2</span>LIVEASY</h3>

            <h3><span class="h3-num">02.3</span>Importance of Logistics App in Turucking Industry</h3>
            <p class="h3-p">
                Trucking and logistics apps have the potential to make the trucking industry more efficient than ever by
                meeting
                consumer demands for packaging services straight with the source. It eliminates the requirement of a
                middleman between
                shippers and truckers while optimizing associated expense and time taken to deliver and receive
                packages. In a nutshell,
                an intuitive truck dispatch software brings an advanced freight management solution to streamline
                logistics and improve
                overall efficiency for shippers, drivers, and carriers. It caters to trucking & logistics businesses and
                startups to
                bring automation and scalability to their operations.

            <h2><span class="h2-num">03</span>CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, No matter the particulars, logistics is the physical fulfillment of a transaction and as
                such is the life
                of the business. Where there is no movement of goods or services, there are no transactions—and no
                profits. Each of these
                factors can significantly move the needle on a company’s success.
