            <h3><span class="h3-num">02.3</span>Changing Packaging and Labeling Requirements</h3>
            <p class="h3-p">
                E-commerce orders often require specific packaging and labeling requirements to ensure that products are
                protected
                during transit and reach customers in good condition. Liveasy understands the importance of adhering to
                these

            <h3><span class="h3-num">02.5</span>Shift towards Last-Mile Delivery Solutions</h3>
            <p class="h3-p">
                Last-mile delivery, the final leg of the delivery process from the fulfillment center to the customer's
                doorstep, has
                become a critical aspect of e-commerce logistics. Liveasy has optimized its last-mile delivery
