                What is SIM based tracking?
            </h1>
            <h2><span class="h2-num">01</span>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The whole crux of a logistics function is to get the goods delivered to the customers at right time, in
                right place, and
                in right assortments. And, for everything to knit in properly, processes at each checkpoint shouldn't
                propagate delays
                to the next. For years, this has been the nightmare for all the parties involved, and still is unless
                everyone involved
                actively exploits the technology available at hand. One such and the most affordable is SIM-based
                tracking
                solution.
            </p>
            <h2><span class="h2-num">02</span>Content</h2>
            <p>
                Sim Based Tracking is made to keep track of fleet activities across multiple locations using the
                location
                coordinates
                recorded by the driver's cellular network. Designed to track, locate, and monitor the fleet's daily
                operations without
                the use of traditional GPS trackers.Now you can save on installation costs and improve productivity at
                the
                same time.

            <h3><span class="h3-num">02.1</span>Technology used</h3>
            <p class="h3-p">
                IM based LBS (Location based Services) tracking solution utilizes Cell ID technology used by Mobile
                Network
                Operator
                (MNO) to locates a mobile device by identifying the serving Base Transceiver Station (BTS) to which the
                hand
                held device
                is connected. The Mobile Network Operator (MNO) using the known physical locations cells/sector
                combination
                with Timing
                advance (TA) information i.e., calculated through Network Measurement Information; this adds the
                improved
                accuracy of
                location of device connected to the network with no dependency on the hand-held device capabilities. All
                that
                information with the help of advance algorithm for real-time location of vehicle plotted on maps for
                better
                visibility
                of cargo for both fleet owners and clients.

            <p>
                SIM based vehicle tracking is reliable and easy to implement. No need to invest in GPS devices. No
                installation hassle.
                Just gain consent of the driver through sms/call and begin tracking on your dashboard. Thus, you need
                not
                worry about
                whether the driver has a smartphone or not. Just share the driver’s mobile details like SIM number or
                IMEI
                so that the
                vendor can help you with tracking data.
