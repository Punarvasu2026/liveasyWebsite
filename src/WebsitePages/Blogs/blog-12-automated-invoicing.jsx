              Automated Invoicing: A Game-Changer in Logistics
            </h2>
            <br />
            <br />
            Traditionally, manual invoicing was a slow, error-prone process
            involving paperwork, human entry, and postal delays. Such outdated
            systems led to:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-1">
              <li>Increased administrative costs</li>
              <li>Delayed settlements</li>
              <li>Frequent invoicing errors and disputes</li>
            </ul>
            With CargoPro’s automated invoicing system, companies can completely
            overhaul this process—turning inefficiency into opportunity.
