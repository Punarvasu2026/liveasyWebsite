            In today’s logistics landscape, efficient indent management is a
            cornerstone of operational success. Traditional processes are often
            manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. But with automated indent
            management, companies can transform logistics workflows—cutting
            costs, improving accuracy, and enhancing customer satisfaction.
