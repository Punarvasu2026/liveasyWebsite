          Automated systems eliminate the need for repetitive manual tasks such
          as filling out forms, sending emails for approvals, and following up
          on status. With a digital workflow in place, indents can be generated,
          routed, and approved in real-time, saving hours of manual effort.

            Procurement is a core function in any business, ensuring that the
            necessary goods and services are acquired efficiently and
            cost-effectively. One major challenge in procurement is the
            management of indents or purchase requests, which can become
            complicated, slow, and prone to errors when handled manually.
            <br />
            <br />
            To overcome these limitations, companies are increasingly adopting
            automated indent management systems like those offered by CargoPro.
            <br />
            Automated indent management systems simplify and streamline the
            process of creating, approving, and tracking purchase requests,
            ultimately improving procurement efficiency and reducing operational
            delays.
