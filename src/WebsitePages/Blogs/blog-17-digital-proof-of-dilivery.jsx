              The Problem with Traditional Invoicing
            </h2>
            <br />
            <br />
            Manual invoicing creates friction across the supply chain. Delays in
            receiving proof of delivery (POD) lead to delays in invoice
            generation. Inaccuracies in data entry or missing documents can
            result in disputes, payment hold-ups, and dissatisfied customers.

              The Solution: Digital Proof of Delivery (POD)
            </h2>
            <br />
            <br />
            CargoPro offers a digital POD system that replaces paperwork with
            real-time, verified delivery data. By digitizing the delivery
            confirmation process, businesses can automate invoicing and improve
            both speed and accuracy.
