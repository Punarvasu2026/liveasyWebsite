      paragraph: (
        <>
          Modern logistics systems generate vast amounts of data — from IoT
          sensors and telematics to WMS, ERP, and GPS tools. But raw data alone
          isn’t enough. You need platforms that:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li>Collect and process data in real time</li>
            <li>Centralize data from multiple sources (devices, apps, APIs)</li>
            <li>Visualize trends across locations and operations</li>
          </ul>
          CargoPro is designed to aggregate and interpret complex logistics data
          — from vehicle telemetry to indent cycles — so you can see the full
          picture and make faster, smarter decisions.
        </>

      heading: "Predictive Analytics for Proactive Planning",
      image: RevolutionizingLogisticsImage2,
      paragraph: (
        <>
          Predictive analytics uses machine learning models to forecast what’s
          likely to happen next. This means:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li>Anticipating shipment delays based on weather or traffic</li>
            <li>Forecasting demand to optimize vehicle allocation</li>
            <li>Detecting patterns that lead to operational bottlenecks</li>
          </ul>
          With CargoPro, logistics managers can simulate scenarios, allocate
          fleets based on predicted load volumes, and avoid downtime by
          proactively resolving issues — before they disrupt your supply chain.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      heading: "Smarter Route Optimization & ETA Accuracy",
      image: RevolutionizingLogisticsImage3,
      paragraph: (
        <>
          Static route planning is outdated. You need tools that adjust
          dynamically in real time. A modern platform should:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li>
              Analyze real-time traffic, road conditions, and delivery
              constraints
            </li>
            <li>Suggest optimal routes for cost and speed</li>
            <li>Track shipments with precise ETAs</li>
          </ul>
          CargoPro’s advanced routing engine combines GPS, vehicle health data,
          and predictive traffic analysis to ensure your vehicles are always on
          the best path — improving OTD rates and fuel efficiency.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      heading: "Accurate Demand Forecasting & Inventory Management",
      image: RevolutionizingLogisticsImage4,
      paragraph: (
        <>
          Balancing supply and demand is crucial for both cost control and
          service reliability. Look for tools that:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li>
              Analyze historical demand, seasonal trends, and market signals
            </li>
            <li>Recommend stock levels by location or zone</li>
            <li>Minimize overstocking and stockouts</li>
          </ul>
          With CargoPro, logistics companies get demand-driven insights that
          allow them to sync warehouse, transport, and delivery workflows —
          avoiding excess costs while maintaining high availability.
        </>

    },
    {
      heading: "Risk Detection and Disruption Management",
      image: logisticsImage,
      paragraph: (
        <>
          The supply chain is vulnerable to many disruptions — weather,
          geopolitical events, port strikes, etc. The right platform should:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li>Monitor global and local risk indicators</li>
            <li>Flag anomalies in shipment timelines</li>
            <li>Suggest rerouting or load redistribution</li>
          </ul>
          CargoPro delivers proactive alerts and early warning signals by
          analyzing both internal and external data sources — enabling you to
          respond before a disruption becomes a crisis.
