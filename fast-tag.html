            How FAST TAG improves the good transport?

        </h1>
        <h2><span class="h2-num">01</span>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            FASTag is an electronic toll collection system in India, operated by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). It
            employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for making toll payments directly from the prepaid or savings
            account linked to it or directly toll owner. It is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle and enables to drive through
            toll plazas without stopping for transactions. The tag can be purchased from official Tag issuers or participating Banks
            and if it is linked to a prepaid account, then recharging or top-up can be as per requirement. The minimum recharge
            amount is ₹100 and can be done online.
        </p>
        <h2><span class="h2-num">02</span>Content</h2>
        <p>
            As of now only a few truck drivers have FASTAG system on their vehicles but in near future, all drivers would have
            FASTAG on their vehicles by which time and efforts would be saved by eliminating the need to stand in long queues for
            hours but the question arises that how does it going to take place.
        </p>
        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.1</span>What is the work of FASTag??</h3>
        <p class="h3-p">
            FASTag allows an end-customer to pay the toll without stopping their vehicle at the toll plaza. FASTags, attached to the
            windscreens of vehicles, use Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) to enable the electronic payment of tolls
            while the vehicle is in motion When the QR code and tag identification number are read by an RFID antenna in the toll gate canopy, the boom
            barrier is raised to enable the vehicle to pass through. The color of the FASTag is different for various vehicles.
            There are black, blue, green, pink, orange, and violet tags. Different vehicles are represented by different colors.

        </p>
        <h3><span class="h3-num">02.2</span>Benefits of Using FASTag</h3>
        <ul class="h3-p-ul">
            <li>Saves time: Using the FASTag technology, you will not have to lower the speed of your vehicle at the toll plazas.</li>
            <li>Avoids traffic jams: Since the traffic does not have to stop or slow down, there is almost no congestion or traffic jam
            at the toll plazas</li>
            <li>Eliminates the hassle of cash payments: Traveling from one city/state to another by road comes across a lot of toll
            plazas.</li>
            <li>
                Saves the environment: The FASTag facility benefits the environment in the long run, as it reduces the use of paper and
                fuel

            </li>
            <li>
                Offers monthly travel pass: Regular travelers can apply to convert their monthly, regular passes into FASTag passes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Easy online recharge: While various other digital wallets let you recharge your FASTag on your mobile phone in a matter
                of minutes

            </li>

        </ul>
                <h3><span class="h3-num">02.3</span>Future of FASTag</h3>

        <p class="h3-p">
            So in the future firstly the industry will move towards the betterment of drivers' life for example as of now only a few
            truck drivers have FASTAG system on their vehicles but in near future, all drivers would have FASTAG on their vehicles
            by which time and efforts would be saved by eliminating the need to stand in long queues for hours but the question
            arises that how does it going to take place.
        </p>
        <p class="h3-p">
        That's where New age Startups and Traditionals companies will step in. They will make drivers families with the new age
        technology which would eventually help them to generate a good source of income through driving. Through technological
        advancement, there won't be any hassle in RTO. There would be more training for the truck drivers so that they could
        know the basics of everything.

        <h2><span class="h2-num">03</span>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, technology has changed the way we do business. Thus, by connecting the truck owners and lenders using the
            FASTag as a point of sale delivery of the loan, the trucking industry and in turn the Indian economy’s growth, can be
            fuelled using cashless transactions and lending.
